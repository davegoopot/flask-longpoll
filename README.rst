Flask Long-Poll Example
========================

This is a little throw-away code to understand how to do chunked response http
requests using Flask and python3.

To run::

  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh

  cd /vagrant
  python3 longpoll.py


Then back on the host OS connect your browser to http://localhost:8889

(test)
